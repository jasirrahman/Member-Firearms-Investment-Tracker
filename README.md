# Member-Firearms-Investment-Tracker
The goal of this project was to scrape the Congressional disclosures record to find evidence of members investing directly into the firearms industry. I leveraged web scraping to automate this process. I constructed web scrapers using Selenium and PyPDF2, to read Financial Disclosure reports and detect keywords that are related to the gun industry.
