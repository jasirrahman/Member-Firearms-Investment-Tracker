They are not available to examine in bulk, but we can easily access the links to the individual member disclosures for any given year from the website. The key barrier to access is the need to acknowledge the legality of accesing and using disclosure information. This is automatically navigated to when you click on the links in our databases, and must be circumnavigated when starting a bulk session to access them. We can use Selenium to crawl the web through a remote driver, which automatically controls webpages and can interact with elements, for example by clicking on an acknowledgement box. We use Selenium to click the box, then access the webpages in our database, and search them for firearms industry actors.\n",
